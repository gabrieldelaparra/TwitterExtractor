# Twitter dataset builder ![twitts](http://i.imgur.com/tXSoThF.png)

I created this small tool to load twitts from an account.

The following Environment Variables are required to be set:
- CONSUMER_KEY
- CONSUMER_SECRET
- ACCESS_TOKEN
- ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

A predicate can be passed to filter the twitts. 

It has to be added by code, not sure if a predicate can be passed via CLI, but not in my current scope/interest.
